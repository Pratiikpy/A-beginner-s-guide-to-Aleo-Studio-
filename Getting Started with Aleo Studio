Getting Started with Aleo Studio:

In this section, I will show you how to create a new project in Aleo Studio, or how to open an existing one. I will also explain the basic structure and components of a Leo project, such as the `src` folder, the `main.leo` file, the `input` folder, the `output` folder, etc. Finally, I will demonstrate how to write a simple "Hello World" program in Leo, and how to run it and see the output in Aleo Studio.

### Creating a New Project:

To create a new project in Aleo Studio, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Aleo Studio.
2. Click on "New Project" or "Create Project".
3. Enter a name for your project and choose a location to save it.
4. Click "Create" to initialize your new Leo project.

Alternatively, you can use the `leo new` command in the terminal to create a new project. For example, you can run `leo new hello-world` to create a project named `hello-world`.

### Opening an Existing Project:

To open an existing project in Aleo Studio, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Aleo Studio.
2. Click on "Open Project" or "Open Folder".
3. Navigate to the folder where your project is located and select it.
4. Click "Open" to load your Leo project.

Alternatively, you can use the `leo open` command in the terminal to open an existing project. For example, you can run `leo open hello-world` to open the project named `hello-world`.

### Understanding the Project Structure:

A Leo project has a default structure with essential files and directories. Here is an example of what a Leo project looks like:

```
hello-world
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ input
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.in
â”œâ”€â”€ output
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.out
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.proof
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ main.leo
```

Let's go over each file and directory and see what they do:

- `.gitignore`: This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing or pushing your code to a remote repository. You can modify this file according to your needs, but it is recommended to keep the default settings.
- `Cargo.toml`: This file contains the metadata and dependencies of your Leo project. You can edit this file to add or remove packages, change the version number, specify the authors, etc.
- `input`: This directory contains the input files for your Leo program. Each input file has a `.in` extension and corresponds to a Leo file with the same name. For example, `main.in` is the input file for `main.leo`. You can use input files to provide values for your program variables or parameters.
- `output`: This directory contains the output files for your Leo program. Each output file has either a `.out` or a `.proof` extension and corresponds to a Leo file with the same name. For example, `main.out` is the output file for `main.leo`. The `.out` file contains the console output of your program, while the `.proof` file contains the zero-knowledge proof of your program.
- `src`: This directory contains the source code files for your Leo program. Each source code file has a `.leo` extension and can contain functions, circuits, imports, exports, etc. The main entry point of your program is always `main.leo`, which is where you write your main logic and call other functions or circuits.

### Writing a Hello World Program:

Now that you have created and opened your Leo project, you can start writing your first program in Leo. A Hello World program is a simple program that prints "Hello World" to the console. Here is how you can write a Hello World program in Leo:

1. Open the `src/main.leo` file in Aleo Studio.
2. Delete any existing code in the file and replace it with this code:

```leo
function main() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
```

3. Save the file.

This code defines a function named `main`, which is the entry point of your program. Inside the function body, there is a single statement that calls the `console.log` function with a string argument `"Hello World"`. The `console.log` function prints its argument to the console output.

### Running and Testing Your Program:

To run and test your Hello World program in Aleo Studio, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal window in Aleo Studio by clicking on "Terminal" > "New Terminal".
2. In the terminal window, run this command: `leo run`
3. Wait for the command to finish executing.

The `leo run` command will compile your Leo code, generate proofs for your program, and execute it with the default input file (if any). You will see the output of your program in the terminal window, as well as in the `output/main.out` file. You will also see the proof of your program in the `output/main.proof` file.

If your program runs successfully, you should see something like this in the terminal window:

```
     Build Starting...
     Build Compiling main program... ("hello-world/src/main.leo")
     Build Finished
     Test Starting...
     Test Running main program... ("hello-world/src/main.leo")
     Hello World
     Test Complete
```

Congratulations! You have just written, run, and tested your first Leo program in Aleo Studio. You can now explore more features and functionalities of Leo and Aleo Studio, and create more complex and interesting applications.
