Writing Applications with Leo:

In this section, I will dive deeper into the syntax and features of Leo, and how to use them to write more complex and interesting applications. I will cover topics such as:

- Assertions and errors
- Annotations and comments

I will provide code examples for each topic, and explain how they work and what they do.

### Assertions and errors:

Assertions are statements that check if a condition is true or false. Assertions can be used to verify the correctness of your program, or to enforce some invariants or preconditions. Leo uses the keyword `assert` followed by a boolean expression and an optional message to construct assertions. For example, you can write an assertion that checks if a number is positive like this:

```leo
let x = 10;
assert x > 0;
```

This assertion evaluates the expression `x > 0` as a boolean value. If it is true, the assertion passes and the program continues. If it is false, the assertion fails and the program aborts with an error message.

You can also provide a custom message for the assertion using the syntax `assert condition, "message";`. For example, you can write an assertion with a message like this:

```leo
let x = -5;
assert x > 0, "x must be positive";
```

This assertion fails and aborts the program with the message "x must be positive".

Errors are values that indicate that something went wrong in your program. Errors can be caused by invalid input, unexpected output, or other exceptional situations. Leo uses the keyword `error` followed by a string to construct errors. For example, you can write an error that indicates that a division by zero occurred like this:

```leo
let x = 10;
let y = 0;
if y == 0 {
    return error "division by zero";
}
```

This error returns a value of type `Error` with the message "division by zero". The error value can be handled by the caller of the function, or propagated to the top level of the program.

You can also use the `?` operator to propagate errors automatically. The `?` operator can be applied to any expression that returns a value of type `Result<T, E>`, where `T` is the success type and `E` is the error type. The `Result<T, E>` type is a built-in type that represents either a successful value of type `T` or an error value of type `E`. The `?` operator unwraps the result and returns the success value if it exists, or returns the error value if it exists. For example, you can use the `?` operator to propagate errors from a function that performs division like this:

```leo
function divide(x: u32, y: u32) -> Result<u32, Error> {
    if y == 0 {
        return error "division by zero";
    } else {
        return Ok(x / y);
    }
}

function main() -> Result<u32, Error> {
    let x = 10;
    let y = 0;
    let z = divide(x, y)?;
    return Ok(z);
}
```

This program defines a function named `divide` that takes two parameters of type `u32` and returns a value of type `Result<u32, Error>`. The function checks if the second parameter is zero or not. If it is zero, it returns an error with the message "division by zero". If it is not zero, it returns a success value with the quotient of the two parameters.

The program also defines a function named `main` that calls the `divide` function with two arguments and assigns the result to a variable named `z`. The result is unwrapped using the `?` operator. If the result is an error, it is returned from the function. If the result is a success value, it is assigned to `z`. The function then returns a success value with `z`.

If you run this program, you will see an error message like this:

```
     Build Starting...
     Build Compiling main program... ("error/src/main.leo")
     Build Finished
     Test Starting...
     Test Running main program... ("error/src/main.leo")
     Program failed due to unhandled error: "division by zero"
     Test Failed
```

This shows that the error from the `divide` function was propagated to the `main` function and caused the program to fail.

### Annotations and comments:

Annotations are special keywords that can be used to modify or provide information about your code. Annotations can be used for various purposes, such as specifying visibility, mutability, inlineability, testability, etc. Leo uses different symbols to denote different kinds of annotations. For example:

- The symbol `@` denotes visibility annotations. Visibility annotations control which parts of your code are accessible from other modules or files. Leo supports two visibility annotations: `@public` and `@private`. The `@public` annotation makes a circuit, function, or trait visible to other modules or files. The `@private` annotation makes a circuit, function, or trait invisible to other modules or files. By default, all circuits, functions, and traits are `@private`. For example, you can write a public function that prints "Hello World" like this:

```leo
@public
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
```

This function can be imported and called from other modules or files.

- The symbol `#` denotes mutability annotations. Mutability annotations control whether a variable or a field can be changed after it is declared. Leo supports two mutability annotations: `mut` and `const`. The `mut` annotation makes a variable or a field mutable, which means it can be changed after it is declared. The `const` annotation makes a variable or a field constant, which means it cannot be changed after it is declared. By default, all variables and fields are constant. For example, you can write a mutable variable that stores the number of times a function is called like this:

```leo
let mut counter = 0;

function increment() {
    counter = counter + 1;
}
```

This variable can be modified by the function.

- The symbol `!` denotes inline annotations. Inline annotations control whether a function or a circuit is inlined or not. Inlining is a compiler optimization technique that replaces a function or a circuit call with its body, eliminating the overhead of the call. Leo supports two inline annotations: `inline` and `noinline`. The `inline` annotation suggests that a function or a circuit should be inlined if possible. The `noinline` annotation suggests that a function or a circuit should not be inlined if possible. By default, the compiler decides whether to inline a function or a circuit or not. For example, you can write an inline function that adds two numbers like this:

```leo
!inline
function add(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8 {
    return x + y;
}
```

This function may be replaced by its body when it is called.

- The symbol `$` denotes test annotations. Test annotations control whether a function is a test case or not. Test cases are functions that can be run by the testing framework to check the correctness of your code. Leo supports one test annotation: `test`. The `test` annotation marks a function as a test case that can be run by the testing framework. Test cases must have no parameters and no return type. Test cases can use assertions to check the expected output or behavior of your code. For example, you can write a test case that checks if the `add` function works correctly like this:

```leo
$test
function test_add() {
    let x = 3;
    let y = 4;
    let z = add(x, y);
    assert z == 7;
}
```

This test case calls the `add` function with two arguments and assigns the result to a variable named `z`. It then asserts that `z` is equal to 7.

Comments are pieces of text that can be used to document or explain your code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and have no effect on the execution of your code. Leo supports two kinds of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start with two slashes (`//`) and end at the end of the line. Multi-line comments start with a slash and an asterisk (`/*`) and end with an asterisk and a slash (`*/`). For example, you can write comments like this:

```leo
// This is a single-line comment

/* This is
a multi-line
comment */
```

These comments have no effect on the code.

These are some of the basic assertions, errors, annotations, and comments in Leo. You can use them to write programs that are more robust, readable, and maintainable. In the next section, I will show you how to write imports and exports in Leo.
